# Processing-2015-New-York-City-Street-Tree-Census-Data

This project reads the NYC open data set, TreesCount!, the 2015 Street Tree Census, conducted by volunteers and organized by the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation as well as partner organizations. The data includes information about more than 680,000 trees on the streets of New York City. 

This project reads the data from that data set and save the data in an Avl tree. It allows a user to summarize certain aspects of the data, such as how many trees of a given species are growing, borough by borough, or which trees are within a given distance of a given GPS location. The user will be able to specify a fragment of a species common name, such as oak and the program will display the frequency of occurrence of all types of oak trees throughout the city, such as pin oaks, sawtooth oaks, scarlet oaks, and white oaks.


The specific discription of this project can be found in project2.pdf. In addition, "tree_species.h" and "tree_species.o" were given by Prof.Weiss.
